# Lashed By Anna - React App Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

Your website has been converted to a modern React application with full admin functionality!

### 1. Get Your Clerk API Keys

1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys)
2. Create a new application or use existing one
3. Choose **React** and copy your **Publishable Key**
4. Update `.env.local` with your actual Clerk key:

```bash
# Replace this with your actual Clerk Publishable Key
REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_actual_key_here
```

**Important**: For Create React App, use `REACT_APP_` prefix (not `VITE_`)

### 2. Set Up Firebase (Already Configured)

Your Firebase is already configured with your existing project. No changes needed!

The app will open at http://localhost:3000
